No, the film is weird in the sense of&nbsp;"Can anyone but Chris Pine truly appreciate this?" I'm not asking that question because I&nbsp;disliked "Poolman." I thought it was sweet and fun, and once I&nbsp;settled into it and latched into its wavelength, I laughed a lot, even though it does start to wear out its welcome towards the end because so much of it is dependent upon exploring the emotional interior of the kind of guy you'd be happy to chat with at a bus stop but wouldn't want to sit next to.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The 13 Worst Horror Movies Of 2012</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos Alright, confession time – I never really WANT to write a “Worst Of” horror list because I try to find value in every horror movie, and it’s always easy to pick on the weak.

<a href=../../zodiac-not-your-usual-serial-killer-movie.html></a>
This is not a standard, flashy, serial killer story with chases, shoot-outs or even the obligatory lines of the genre such as: "he's never going to stop; he's going to go on and on until somebody does something." It deals with dozens of characters and a huge number of facts. Fincher organizes them in a fairly comprehensible manner, but this doesn't mean he makes it easy for the audience to keep up, as we're constantly in danger of getting lost with the shifting from one line of investigation to another.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/41/>← Prev Page</a>
