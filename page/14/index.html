Bill Nighy is the first of the excellent cast to make an appearance, standing alone on a beach, talking into a phone. His Alan is a tetchy but garrulous gent, yammering on to the guy who runs the beach ice cream truck about his son, who as it happens works as a painter of such vehicles. Peter (Sam Riley), said son, is a little ill at ease at about the father and son reunion, particularly as he had envisioned it as an afternoon outing, while Alan has booked them at a retro B&B that, yes—like several visuals that occur and recur in this picture—looks maybe like something out of a Wes Anderson movie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nahila Bonfiglio, Author at We Got This Covered Page 17 of 155</h2><time>Aug 6, 2024</time>

For a while there, it looked like Red Hood was coming to the DCEU fairly soon as Jason Todd’s death at the hands of the Joker was referenced in both&nbsp;Batman V Superman and&nbsp;Suicide Squad. However, now that the franchise is going in a different direction with the Bat-mythos – Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight will be much younger and less-experienced than Ben Affleck’s – it doesn’t look like the former sidekick-turned-anti-hero is on the table at the moment.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/13/>← Prev Page</a>
