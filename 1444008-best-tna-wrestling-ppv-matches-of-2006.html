The Icon returned to the promotion three years after having his last match inside the ring. Angle, on the other hand, showed up in October following a highly successful stint in WWE.</p><p>The Wrestling Machine would give TNA critically acclaimed matches for years to come. Angle’s rivalries with the likes of Samoa Joe, Sting, and AJ Styles would draw praise from fans and peers until the end of their careers in the promotion. That being said, let’s take a look at some of the best TNA Wrestling PPV matches of 2006:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. America’s Most Wanted (NWA World Tag Team Title Match – Slammiversary 2006)</h2><p>One of the best TNA Wrestling PPV matches of 2006 came courtesy of AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels and America’s Most Wanted. This match was a follow-up to their excellent outing from Sacrifice 2006.</p><p>Chris Harris and James Storm were the perfect throwback to the eighties style of tag team wrestling. Both men limited Styles’ explosive offense by working his back. The Phenomenal One managed to make a comeback and even countered Gail Kim’s distraction with help from Daniels.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe (TNA X-Division Title Three-way Match – Against All Odds)</h2><p>After giving TNA Wrestling their first five-star match at Unbreakable 2005, these three men ran it back for the X-Division Championship at Against All Odds 2006. This bout featured a good mix of fast-paced action and technical wrestling.</p><p>AJ Styles and Christopher Daniels tried to outdo each other at almost every opportunity in this match-up. The continuous run-ins offered Joe an opening, which he capitalized to retain the X-Division title.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe – TNA Turning Point</h2><p>The ending to their historic encounter at Genesis set up a rematch for Turning Point 2006. Unlike their previous encounter, this match had more time to it and, as a result, was much more structured with some excellent submission work.</p><p>Joe’s relentless attitude forced Angle to resort to cheap tactics. The Wrestling Machine knocked out the referee to give himself an unfair advantage, but Joe survived and claimed the win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>LAX vs. AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels (NWA World Tag Team Championship Ultimate X Match – TNA No Surrender)</h2><p>LAX versus AJ Styles and Christopher Daniels is considered one of the best matches in TNA Wrestling history. Both teams were involved in a high-profile program for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in 2006.</p><p>Homicide and Hernandez were the defending NWA World Tag Team Champions heading into TNA No Surrender. The match featured some nasty bumps and insane action, especially the Styles Clash from the apron onto a table.</p><p>Daniels would unhook the titles for his team following a huge leap onto the scaffold to a huge pop from the crowd.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-kurt-angle-vs-samoa-joe-genesis>Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe – Genesis</h2><p>Kurt Angle made his TNA debut at the expense of Samoa Joe on October 19, 2006. The Olympic Gold Medalist would cut open the Samoan Submission Machine with a nasty headbutt, only for Joe to rise up and deliver an enziguri of his own.</p><p>Both men would kickoff their historic rivalry at the Genesis PPV event in November. The electric atmosphere in Orlando added to the overall presentation. Joe was absolutely relentless in this match as he went for the cut on Angle’s head.</p><p>This match featured great back-and-forth mat exchange with Angle showing off his technical prowess. The closing sequence was spectacular as it made Joe’s first defeat inside the six-sided ring feel legitimate.</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li>AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. LAX (TNA Bound for Glory)</li><li>Samoa Joe vs. Monty Brown vs. Rhino (Hard Justice)</li><li>Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels (TNA Final Resolution)</li><li>Christian Cage vs. Abyss (Lockdown)</li></ul><p>: <a href=#>Best TNA Wrestling PPV Matches Of 2007</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAk21naXBdl7K0wIytpZplp6eytMDLoqWgZaClw265wK2aoZ2jYryneZFpZ28%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sharon-osbourne-dresses-up-kanye-west-wife-bianca-censori-revealing-costume.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Out, Bianca Censori!
