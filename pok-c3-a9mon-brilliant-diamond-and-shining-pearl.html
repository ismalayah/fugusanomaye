Additionally, when a compatible Pokémon from another game first enters these sets of games, its moveset is changed to its four most recent level-up moves by default (though the player can make alterations as of HOME's version 3.0.0, released on May 30, 2023).</p><p>Users of HOME can transfer Pokémon between other Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl save files on the console, even if the files belong to different profiles.</p><p>Only Pokémon that exist in the game data (i.e. those from the first four generations of games, excluding <a href=# title="Regional form">regional forms</a>) can be transferred to Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.
