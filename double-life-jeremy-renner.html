In <a href=#>an interview with Ellen DeGeneres</a>, the star admitted that becoming a father kind of messed up his career because it's all he really cares about. "She's like number one in my life, and then now I get to do movies on the side. Daddy's my best role to date, I think," he said. Of course, since it's Renner, the new gig couldn't possibly come without controversy.</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Renner became embroiled in a new nasty custody battle with his ex-wife. The pair's&nbsp;originally agreed-upon joint custody arrangement&nbsp;for their daughter, Ava, went out the window when Pacheco allegedly tried to walk back on their deal. In September 2019, she filed for sole custody with monitored visitation rights for her ex. In the past, she's claimed his gun collection put Ava at risk.&nbsp;In response,&nbsp;Renner asked the courts for the same thing, per&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a>. He claimed that he should have sole custody and Pacheco should only have monitored visitation rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From this latest custody gridlock came even more ugly allegations, again via <a href=#>TMZ</a>, in which <a href=#>Pacheco accused Renner of drug use, as well as verbal and emotional abuse and violence</a>, including "fir[ing] a gun into the ceiling while Ava was asleep in her bedroom." Through his rep, Renner refuted these allegations, saying, "The dramatizations made in Sonni's declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind."</p><p>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website</a> or contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
