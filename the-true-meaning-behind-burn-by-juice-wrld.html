He <a href=#>admits</a> in the first line of the song, "I can't take one Percocet, start tonight off,Ijust took a60," referencing upping his dosage of the opioid. Juice later compares his substance abuse to eternal suffering. "This remind me of hell, sometimes I wonder if that's where God really sent me," he raps. "Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn / I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs."</p><p>Released in tandem with his album "Fighting Demons," the recent documentary <a href=#>"Juice WRLD: Into The Abyss"</a> spotlighted the rapper's struggles with mental health and addiction. The film's director Tommy Oliver spoke to <a href=#>The Guardian</a> about the obvious severity of Juice's personal struggle. "It seemed like he was keenly aware of the possibility or the likelihood [of death]," he said, adding that "is probably one of the reasons why he lived his life as fast as he did." Ultimately, Juice died of accidental overdose in December, 2019, as a result of oxycodone and codeine toxicity, <a href=#>The New York Times</a> reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGlpZn92e9OhnGasoqqybrnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZpqlp7turthmoa6hk5p6uL7LnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sher-suarez-love-island-age-biography-height-job-birthday-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Sher Suarez Love Island: Age, Biography, Height, Job, Birthday, Instagram</span></a>
