However, as fans, we’re always eager to see our Straw Hats take center stage after their absence, and it seems that time might be nigh for Luffy with his imminent clash against Saturn. Admittedly, we’re not certain if he can defeat the elder, but we’re in this for the journey, not the fight.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>What excites me the most, though, is the alliance between Luffy and Borsalino. I can’t help but wonder when we’ll finally see the Emperor of the Sea and the Admiral teaming up, and I assume you feel the same way, so let’s get to it.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-one-piece-chapter-1104-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is One Piece chapter 1104 coming out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Manga-Luffy-Borsalino.jpg><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>The upcoming One Piece chapter is set to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">release on Shonen Jump on January 21, 2024</a>, at 8 a.m. Pacific Time. The chapter will be hitting the shelves a few days earlier in Japan, and as usual, the spoilers will begin circulating on January 17 as the chapter is leaked in the customary channels.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>At this point, we don’t know what to expect from this new chapter, but as usual, fans are speculating about what’s to come. Knowing Oda, we can expect him to kick off the Year of the Dragon with a bang – perhaps with Kuma regaining his conscience and willpower, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luffy transforming into Nika to defeat Saturn</a>.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>Regardless, Saturn needs to go down — no questions asked. Nevertheless, all of this is mere speculation, and as always, we never know what to expect from Oda and his unpredictable antics. Much as we wish to, we can’t dissect his genius brain.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>So, there it is; you just have to wait a bit longer to get the chapter and finally put an end to all the speculation. At least, for a few hours.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWS8r7GMqaCem5VisKmtz62cq2VhZn11edGeo56Zo5p6pa3TnmSappRiwaq5xGaaqKaWnr%2BuscNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-was-bob-barkers-age-at-death.html><span>←</span><span>What was Bob Barkers age at death?</span></a>
