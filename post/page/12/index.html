<a href=../../../avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-ending-explained.html></a>
The explosive end of season 1 of the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender wasn’t just a visual feast, but set up a whole lot of important storylines for the upcoming second season. Not only did we see Aang tap into the immense power of the spirits, but viewers were also given a glimpse into the dastardly plans of Daniel Dae Kim’s unreasonably good-looking Fire Lord Ozai.
Recommended Videos Viewers unfamiliar with the extensive lore of the show might have been left a little confused with what happened, but thankfully Avatar nerds like us are more than happy to become annoying men on first dates and explain everything in painstaking detail.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jimmy McGovern movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>

Expansive globetrotting epics and hard-boiled thrillers are the bread and butter of Netflix’s most-watched charts, but the instantaneous success of The Surrogacy once again showcases that subscribers are more than open to some hard-hitting drama, regardless of its country of origin.
Recommended Videos Per FlixPatrol, the Spanish-language series has topped the rankings in an impressive 27 countries around the world, reaching the Top 10 in 60 nations in total. That’s good enough to place it as the sixth top-viewed series on a global level, an accomplishment that deserves the highest of praise considering it’s got the likes of Never Have I Ever, FUBAR, Black Mirror, and Manifest to contend with.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Kristin Lehman?6 things to know about the actress</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../cassadaga-2011.html></a>
"Cassadaga" starts with a kid as messed up as Norman Bates, a boy who dresses in drag and mutilates himself in a way that the musical score gently reminds us is terrible, at "Inception" decibel levels. Then it gets another story going, about a deaf teacher grieving the accidental death of her sister while discovering her own psychic powers. Eventually, the two threads will converge. The messed up kid, all grown up now, will have the pretty teacher tied up in a basement, where she almost escapes, crawling on the dingy stone floor in a nightgown.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>El Topo movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1970)</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../great-movie-el-topo-1970.html></a>
The film is also populated, as Jodorowsky's films are, by physically challenged characters; amputees, people with Down syndrome, dwarfs, those whose bodies end at their trunks, men who talk with women's voices, women who talk with men's, a man without legs riding on the shoulders of a man without arms, and one of the most persistent images in the director's work, a symbiosis between a person without arms and another who stands close behind and allows his arms to act as the other's.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart movie review (2023)</h2><time>Aug 14, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../the-lost-flowers-of-alice-hart-tv-review-2023.html></a>
Introduced as a child, Alice Hart (Alyla Brown) lives in a state of constant threat at the hands of her abusive father, Clem (Charlie Vickers). She adores her mother, Agnes (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), who is captured almost as a mythical creature in the early chapters in how a child can view an adult they want to save. Mom can’t be human. She must be a selkie who can escape this horror. When Alice wanders into town one day, she catches the attention of a librarian named Sally (Asher Keddie), setting in motion a sequence of events that will lead to the death of Agnes and Clem, forcing Alice to go live with her grandmother June (Sigourney Weaver) on a flower farm called Thornfield that’s actually a women’s shelter.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/11/>← Prev Page</a>
