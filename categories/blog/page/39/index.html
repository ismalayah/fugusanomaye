Long before any sort of justice had ever dawned,&nbsp;Freddy vs. Jason&nbsp;debuted in cinemas to&nbsp;what may be remembered as the first notable crossover between two major film franchises. Since then, we’ve received a couple&nbsp;Alien vs. Predator&nbsp;movies, the second of which performed so poorly that Fox split them back into their own separate entities, and to a much, much lesser extent,&nbsp;Lake Placid vs. Anaconda.

<a href=../../../../day-of-the-dead-bloodline-2018.html></a>
“Day of the Dead: Bloodline” feels like one of those zombie flicks that was slightly tweaked here and there to resemble the 1985 Romero film but could have started life as any sort of flick featuring brain-eaters. The shared DNA with Romero’s flick is in two key aspects of this new work—the setting of a remote military-run complex after the world has been overrun by the undead and a 'Bub' character who seems a little different than your run-of-the-mill zombie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mariko Van Kampen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>May 19, 2024</time>

(His condition is not inspired by a real disease, but was created by the filmmakers.) Williams works hard at seeming to be a kid inside an adult body, and some of his inspirations work well.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Toni Braxton Net Worth: How the R&amp;amp;B Legend Made Her Fortune</h2><time>May 18, 2024</time>
