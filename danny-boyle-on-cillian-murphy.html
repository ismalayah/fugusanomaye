<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Danny Boyle Explains What Made Cillian Murphy So Special from the Start | Interviews</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>During pre-production on that film, you put the actors through a </strong><a href=#><strong>boot camp</strong></a><strong>, making them live together for a while to get used to their characters’ situation. Since Murphy plays the protagonist, did he take a leadership role during that boot camp?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>He would never assume leadership—he would just be part of [the group]. He leads movies, but he’s not someone who takes on the kind of front role.</p><p>I obviously didn’t live with them—they lived together, and I think one or two of them were a bit surprised that they were going to literally be living together for a couple of weeks. But music was a big help. The other thing about him is his music—he hosts shows on the BBC, on Radio 6. His musical taste is wonderful.</p><p><strong>What kind of music is he into?</strong></p><p>Eclectic high quality. I think that’s one of the things he liked about us working together, because <a href=#>I’m really music-driven as well</a>. He’s got an inexhaustible appetite for music. His show that he did during lockdown [“Songs From Under the Stairs”], he locks himself away, and that’s his quiet place.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>When you two reunited for “Sunshine,” did you notice that his acting approach changed from film to film?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There was no research on the first film because it was [about] an apocalypse, but the second one, he was very diligent. He struck up a really good friendship with this scientist, <a href=#>Brian Cox</a>. Weirdly, he sort of looks like Cillian. [Laughs] And he went to <a href=#>CERN</a>, which is where they fire the atoms around a huge circular particle accelerator. He spent a lot of time [researching], and then he trusts his intuition.&nbsp;</p><p>I can imagine he did that on “Oppenheimer”—he trusts the scene and the interaction with the other actors. I don't remember ever struggling with [him], like you can with some actors and some parts. When trying to get to grips with [a role], he preps and then he gives the absolute impression of having done no prep at all—he’s ready to go.&nbsp;</p><p>We got on really well, and we’re hoping to get it together again on the sequel that we’re doing to “28 Days Later,” this “28 Years Later.” It’s not a deal done yet, but hopefully we’ll be able to get back together on that—if he’ll ever speak to me again.
