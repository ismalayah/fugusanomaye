Although there are no recorded specifics of the event, those close to McNeely allege that he slid over a cliff near Moab for reasons unrelated to climbing. McNeely climbed approximately 60 pitches on El Capitan in the Valley and spent hundreds of days on the wall.&nbsp;According to Tom Evans, a Yosemite photographer, “McNeely was a driving force for wall climbers in Yosemite for many years.”</p><p>He had a unique personality and was well-regarded by climbers in Yosemite and abroad. He will be missed and remembered throughout the Valley. My condolences to the family and friends. McNeely’s El Capitan speed ascents are many and remarkable. Brian McCray and Chris McNamara accomplished the first one-day ascents of multiple routes, including the Wall of Early Morning Light and the Atlantic Ocean Wall, in 2004. McNeely, Dean Potter, and Ivo Ninov ascended the Reticent Wall in 2006 in 34 hours and 57 minutes, breaking the previous record by five days.</p><p>In addition, he and Skiy Detray set the record for the quickest climb of Scorched Earth in 2011.&nbsp;McNeely established a record in Zion for the quickest climb of the Streaked Wall’s three routes in a single day: Latitudes 5.9 A4+, Rodeo Queen 5.10 A4+, and Tale of the Scorpion 5.10A3+.&nbsp;He is well-known for his daring BASE jumps and has been involved in a number of mishaps, one of which resulted in the loss of his right leg below the knee in 2017.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=an-american-rock-climber-was-killed-in-an-accident></span>An American rock climber was killed in an accident.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ammon McNeely, one of Yosemite’s most well-known large wall speed climbers, died at the age of 52. McNeely used a piece of his BASE gear to create a tourniquet on his leg since blood was “squirting everywhere.” Over the phone, he informed his buddies that he could pass out and required a helicopter rescue. His EMT buddy Dave, Brent, Andy, and a few Moab locals discovered him on the ledge about 45 minutes later, where they attached lines and drilled a three-bolt anchor before search and rescue officials arrived.&nbsp;McNeely thinks his fast thinking and action saved his life. He had lost three quarts of blood by the time the chopper carried him to the hospital.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmdoryvecycpZ6dnK7AbrvBoquumaKueqm71mabopxdnbJusMieZJyZpaiybrvFZpuemaSdeqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-aaron-stanford-between-x-men-the-last-stand-and-deadpool-3.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Aaron Stanford between X-Men: The Last Stand and Deadpool 3?</span></a>
