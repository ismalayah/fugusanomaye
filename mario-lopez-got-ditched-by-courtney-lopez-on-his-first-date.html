Since then, the couple has given birth to three children. Lopez and his wife routinely profess their affection on social media. They’ve also told the tale of how they met many times.</p><h2>Mario Lopez’s Relationship with His Wife</h2><p>In the autumn of 2008, Lopez met his wife for the first time. He was in New York for the Broadway performance of A Chorus Line when he ran into her immediately before the play began. He subsequently saw her perform and thought she was charming. “She sings, dances, and does everything. Incredibly talented, which is also really appealing, “He revealed this in a YouTube video posted to his channel. “Then I simply sort of loved her appearance. So it was quite appealing as a result of all of that. And she wasn’t trying to give me time or show me affection… It took me a long time to persuade her to go with me.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mario-Lopez-2.jpg alt="Mario Lopez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Mario Lopez was dumped on their first date.</h2><p>Lopez also said in the video that it took him a few months to have a date with Courtney.&nbsp;When the moment came, he was a bit late, and she blew him off. They rescheduled their date for later in the evening, and she brought her homosexual closest buddy with her.&nbsp;“It was kind of like a group date,” he said. “That’s cool… ‘All right,’ I said. Charm the buddy as well. Then he can go back and say, ‘He’s fantastic, I adore that person.’ And that’s exactly what occurred.”&nbsp;Lopez, according to Courtney, wasn’t fully accurate about the narrative since he was previously acquainted with her closest buddy, Nick.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mario-Lopez-3.jpg alt="Mario Lopez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Mario Lopez and his wife are the parents of three children.</h2><p>Lopez and Courtney had their first child together, daughter Gia Francesca Lopez, on September 11, 2010, two years after their first meeting.&nbsp;After four years of dating, they married on December 1, 2012. TLC televised their wedding in a two-hour show titled Mario & Courtney’s Wedding Fiesta. Their two-year-old daughter, Gia, and three of Lopez’s nieces served as flower girls for the actor and his wife’s wedding.</p><p>On September 9, 2013, a year after their marriage, Courtney gave birth to their third child, Dominic Luciano Lopez.&nbsp;In July 2019, Lopez and his wife had their third child, son Santino Rafael Lopez.&nbsp;He shared the news on Instagram by uploading many photos of their child. “It’s a GIRL!!! Baby boy is healthy and gorgeous… Rafael Lopez, Santino! “In the caption, he wrote: “Both the baby and the mother are doing well. Mrs. Lopez performed well!”&nbsp;Lopez told Page Six in April 2020 that he would be astonished if he didn’t have a fourth kid as a result of the epidemic. However, there has been no indication that the couple is expecting another child since then.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqZpHqtu8%2BesWafn6l6pbXTnJ%2BenF2Xxm6vzq6praaVrnqtu8%2BesWannmK1qr%2BMn6Crq6RisaLAxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arjumman-mughal-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-280591-html.html><span>←</span><span>Arjumman Mughal Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
