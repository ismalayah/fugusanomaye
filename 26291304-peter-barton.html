It is the adventures of the blogger and also stories submitted by readers.</p><p>One reader, a makeup artist, submitted a story that involved Tony Danza, Georgie Cloon, Peter Barton and Erich Anderson (Friday The 13th, thirtysomething). FWIW here's the summary:</p><p>Makeup artist guy worked on short lived sitcom in early 90s starring Tony and George, Tony and George became VeryClose. Then they had a falling out and quit speaking to each other. Then George became close with Erich who was a guest on one episode. Makeupartist guy then dated Erich for a short while.</p><p>After Erich, Makeup Artist guy starts dating Peter Barton and brings him to set and introduces him to George. Makeupartist guy invites George to join them on one of their dates, George tags along and pays for dinner and goes back to their apartment with them. George asks them both for blowjobs, Peter declines and retreats to bedroom. Makeupartist guy starts to fondle George, changes his mind before anything happens and sends George on his way. Poor George, paid for dinner and got nothing, lol. George was married to that woman from Mad Men at the time.</p><p>I guess this is more a story about George than anyone else but Peter Barton is in the mix!</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 34</td><td class=timestamp><span>June 11, 2020 7:45 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I love all the FRIDAY THE 13TH alumni and Peter Barton was hot.</p><p>But I guess Trumpers will have to go to the back of the line.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 35</td><td class=timestamp><span>June 11, 2020 8:34 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Peter is a single father of a daughter.</p><p>His character on Y&R, Scott Grainger, was killed off.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 36</td><td class=timestamp><span>June 11, 2020 8:55 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>It's him and from his Facebook page (under Peter Thomas Barton).
