<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Tana Mongeaus Obsession With Makeup And Facetune Has Sparked Several Controversies</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Tana Mongeau</strong> has a sizable online following. She has been a divisive figure in the public eye for much of her career. And her use of makeup and Facetune has frequently been one of the major driving forces behind the controversies that have surrounded her.</p><p>Mongeau, on the other hand, has embraced talking about both her makeup obsession and Facetune. She has appeared in her videos without makeup on numerous occasions, usually when discussing some of her most personal and vulnerable moments.</p><p>The internet personality has also shared her makeup tips with her fans, most notably in the trilogy ‘How To Cake Your Face Like A Pro: The Trilogy.’ In a three-part video series, she described all of her makeup routines.</p><p>Mongeau explained that she enjoyed making those videos because she enjoyed assisting others; in this case, to cake up and look better. Mongeau has also been candid about her appearance when she isn’t wearing makeup. She rated herself as a two in the aforementioned makeup tutorial video series but would go up to an eight after caking up.</p><p>In her ’10 Things Tana Mongeau Can’t Live Without | Bootleg GQ’ video, she also mentioned fake eyelashes as the one thing she couldn’t live without. Mongeau said in the video that she couldn’t live without a lot of things, including Backwoods cigars, but she put eyelashes at the top of the list, saying they were the most important thing she couldn’t live without.</p><h2>Quick Facts About Tana Marie Mongeau</h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td><strong>Tana Marie Mongeau</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>24 June 1998</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>25 years</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height/How tall?<br></strong></td><td>5 feet 5 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>YouTuber & Rapper</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father Name</strong></td><td>Rick Mongeau</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother Name</strong></td><td>Rebecca Mongeau</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Married?</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Gay?<br></strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$4 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Tana Mongeau Net worth</h2><p><strong>Tana Mongeau’s net worth is about $4 million as of December 2023.</strong></p><h2>Controversy Over Mongeau’s Facetune</h2><p>Mongeau has been open about her use of Facetune to edit her photos, just as she has been about her makeup. Back in November 2019, she was chastised for overusing the app in her photos of the People’s Choice Awards.</p><p>After she posted her photo, the post was deluged with comments pointing out how unrecognizable she was. Several people commented on how her face shape had changed dramatically, as well as how many of her facial features had been altered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5f7dce3094fce90018f7b9a0-1.png><p>Along with the actual photograph, the photos were shared on Reddit’s InstagramReality subreddit. After comparing the two, it was clear that she had narrowed her jawline, slimmed down her nose, and changed the shape and darkness of her brows, among other things.</p><p>While Mongeau did not directly address the issue, she did imply that she had heard all of the complaints in a post she made to wish her manager a happy birthday. She ended her caption after wishing her manager,</p><p>“swipe for a pic of me (with less facetune than last time) cause I’m narcissistic.”</p><p>Mongeau, on the other hand, has always admitted to using the photo editing app. Earlier that year, in May, she tweeted, “what if I did a facetune master class tour?” Aside from makeup and photo editing apps, the YouTuber hasn’t been shy about sharing other artificial changes she’s made to her body. Mongeau documented getting butt injections in a vlog titled ‘I got Kylie Jenner butt shots… oops (needle warning)’ in April 2020.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Facetune Controversy</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Tana Mongeau</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirmqaRYrqwusaemK6rXaSvtLHSrKCopl2strW0jKaYpJ2lpXqiusNmnZqblanCr7GMoZisZaOlrrO3xJ1krJ2mmr%2BiuIycpqesoqTDpr7SopysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-petallides-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-341172-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Petallides Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
