Not bad! The comedy-drama, based on Erasure by Percival Everett, follows a middling literary fiction writer who is tired of the fact that black literature tends to fall into poverty porn and reinforce racist stereotypes (many believe that Push by Sapphire was partly responsible for inspiring Everett to write Erasure).</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>To prove this is the case, he writes an incredibly offensive and poorly constructed novel that uses a particularly ghettoized form of ebonics and plays into every negative assumption white culture has about African Americans, only to find that it takes the incredibly white, incredibly privileged literature establishment by storm, leading to all sorts of prestigious awards nominations and shoutouts from so-called liberal establishments.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>The book, and now the film, points out some flaws in the creative industries which have only become worse since Everett wrote it way back in 2001, and is well worth watching for that reason alone. It helps that the movie also has some brilliant names in its cast list, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Issa Rae</a> and Sterling K. Brown, alongside leading man Jeffery Wright, who has put in an inspired performance. If you are a person of color in the literary industry, a lot of the action will undoubtedly hit close to home.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>If you’re a fan of Everett’s source material, or have heard about the movie and think it’s something that will appeal to you, then you might be wondering: is American Fiction streaming?
