His father was a pilot with the Royal Air Force, who moved into civil aviation, and his mother was a former airline stewardess. When he was 4 years old, Clayton’s father worked in Kenya as a pilot with East African Airways, the family being resident in Nairobi (Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood). In 1965, the family moved to Malahide, northern County Dublin, Ireland, where Clayton’s brother Sebastian was born. The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family (including their son David Evans (“The Edge”), who would later co-found the band U2 with Clayton).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$300 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bassist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Clayton has sung on some occasions, including on the song “Endless Deep”, the B-side to the single “Two Hearts Beat As One” from 1983. Clayton also sang backup vocals on “I Will Follow”, “Twilight”, “Trip Through Your Wires” and also on some occasions on “With or Without You” and “Bullet the Blue Sky” during live performances. He also spoke the last verse of “Your Blue Room”. Clayton can be heard speaking on “Tomorrow (’96 Version)” (a rerecording of “Tomorrow” that he arranged) a song from U2’s 1981 album October. He plays the guitar on a few occasions, most notably the song “40”, where he and guitarist The Edge switch instruments. He also plays the keyboards on “City of Blinding Lights” and “Iris (Hold Me Close)”.</p><p>Clayton has worked on several side projects throughout his career. He played (along with the other members of U2) on Robbie Robertson’s self-titled album from 1987, and has also performed with Maria McKee. Clayton played on the song “The Marguerita Suite” on Sharon Shannon’s self-titled debut album which was released in October 1991. He joined U2 producer Daniel Lanois and bandmate Larry Mullen Jr. on Lanois’s 1989 album Acadie, playing the bass on the songs “Still Water” and “Jolie Louise”. In 1994, Clayton played bass along with bandmate Larry Mullen Jr. on Nanci Griffith’s album Flyer, playing on the songs “These Days in an Open Book”, “Don’t Forget About Me”, “On Grafton Street” and “This Heart”. In 1996, Clayton and Mullen contributed to the soundtrack to the 1996 film Mission: Impossible by re-recording the “Theme from Mission: Impossible”. The song reached number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist) in 1997. Clayton was also featured on Steven Van Zandt’s 1999 album Born Again Savage.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Adam Clayton height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Adam <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While the band was a five-piece (consisting of Bono, the Edge, Mullen, Dik Evans, and Clayton) it was known as “Feedback”. The name was subsequently changed to “The Hype”, but changed to “U2” soon after Dik Evans left. Clayton stood in as the nearest thing that the band had to a manager in its early life, handing over the duties to Paul McGuinness in May 1978. In 1981, around the time of U2’s second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.</p><p align=justify>In 1995, after the Zoo TV Tour and Zooropa album, Clayton headed to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then Clayton had been entirely self-taught. During that period, he worked on U2’s experimental album, released under the pseudonym “Passengers”, entitled Original Soundtracks 1. That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of “Your Blue Room”, the album’s second single. Prior to this Clayton had only provided live backing vocals to tracks such as “Out of Control”, “I Will Follow”, “Twilight” and “Bullet the Blue Sky”. Since the 1997 PopMart Tour, Clayton has not sung live in any capacity for the band.</p><h2>Who is Adam Clayton Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Adam Clayton</strong> married to <strong>Mariana Teixeira De Carvalho </strong>.

However, he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity, and later commented: “it was my own fault. And I’m sure I was out of my head&nbsp;– emotionally apart from anything else. But it is serious because it is illegal.” Clayton has also had alcohol problems, which came to a head during the Zoo TV Tour. On 26 November 1993 he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night’s show in Sydney, the dress rehearsal for their Zoo TV concert film. Bass duties had to be fulfilled by Clayton’s technician Stuart Morgan. After that incident, he resolved to give up alcohol, eventually beginning his sobriety in 1996. On 26 June 2017, Clayton received the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the MusiCares 13th annual MAP Fund Benefit Concert in recognition of his commitment to helping others with addiction recovery.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Adam Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Bassist</strong>.
