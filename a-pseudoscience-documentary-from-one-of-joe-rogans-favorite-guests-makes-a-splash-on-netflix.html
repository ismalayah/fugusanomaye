Hancock believes in a an ice age civilization which was destroyed in an apocalyptic event, explaining apparently unexplainable feats of human engineering and early culture.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>Essentially, he believes in Eternals-like figures potentially aiding civilization which have apparently gone completely unnoticed apart from by him. The pseudoarcheology-heavy Netflix original has debuted in their top ten, sitting at seventh spot ahead of comic book adaptation Warrior Nun and Zoe Saldana’s From Scratch.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">With over 24 million hours viewed in its opening week</a>, it’s proven there’s a serious appetite for documentaries based in almost no reality or peer-reviewed research. Welcome to Netflix, conspiracy documentaries. You’ll get on very well with the true crime dramatizations.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>The series is hard to not compare to the History Channel’s many ancient aliens-related theories, and just like those, is getting scorned by real archaeologists. Overwhelmingly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hancock’s claims have been refuted by those in the field</a>, with many criticizing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix for not having anyone to challenge his claims</a>.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>To add further controversy to the fire, Hancock’s son is the head of unscripted content at Netflix. But it’s definitely not nepotism, and is certainly just a stroke of luck his son was able to play a part in him getting a platform. Ancient Apocalypse is available ot stream now, but we advise healthy skepticism.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGaoo5rCpbvSnKCeppOaeqW7wq6knqaklr%2B6ecWrpqZln6OybrvFZqGonV2nvKitzaxkn5mmpL%2BqwMRmnq6do6nAbrnApJysZZFiwLG4wKyfZqeeYrumwMWloLFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcus-freeman-wiki-age-net-worth-wife-ethnicity-height-career.html><span>←</span><span>Marcus Freeman- Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity, Height, Career</span></a>
