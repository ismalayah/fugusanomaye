Barker was the original host of the series, which first aired in 1972, before retiring in 2007, after 35 years.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Yesterday, it was confirmed that Barker died as a result of Alzheimer’s disease, which the TV host had been battling privately for several years, according to a death certificate obtained by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. Hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia&nbsp;were listed as secondary causes that contributed to his death.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Barker died at the age of 99, a fact that led many fans of his work on The Price is Right to make a similar joke in tribute to the star. Barker, born in December 1923, died just four months shy of his 100th birthday.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>For example, Twitter user baileycarlin wrote, “My man got as close as possible without going over a dollar. Legend.”</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>This joke refers to the cardinal rule of The Price is Right during the showcase segment of each episode, where players must bid within a specified amount — which was traditionally under 100, although was later updated to 250 towards the end of Barker’s time on the show in 1998.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The Price is Right was taken over by comedian Drew Carey after Barker’s departure in 2007. Carey still hosts the series to this day and will host a tribute special, titled The Price is Right: A Tribute to Bob Barker, on CBS. The air date of the special is yet to be confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZLCZo2KvsK6Mm5iro5WnwG6txp5kmqxdmbKiwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justified-review-raw-deal-season-5-episode-7.html><span>←</span><span>Justified Review: Raw Deal (Season 5, Episode 7)</span></a>
