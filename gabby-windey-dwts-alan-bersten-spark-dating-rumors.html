In the snap, several plates of food are placed on a restaurant table alongside a hand that does not belong to Windey.</p><p>Both the former ICU nurse and Bersten, 28, were part of the DWTS Tour — which wrapped up earlier this week. While Windey partnered with <a href=#><strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong></a> for season 31 of the Disney+ series, she paired up with the <a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a> alum at one point in the competition after Chmerkovskiy <a href=#>tested positive for COVID-19</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gabby-Windey-Sparks-Rumors-Shes-Dating-%E2%80%98Dancing-With-the-Stars-Pro-Alan-Bersten-After-Posting-About-Dinner-with-a-Mystery-Man-802.jpg><p>Bersten was named the ABC personality’s partner for the Halloween episode as the Ukraine native recovered. Bersten, for his part, was paired with <a href=#><strong>Jessie James Decker</strong></a> for the season, but the duo was eliminated one week prior.</p><p>At the time, Windey was engaged to <a href=#><strong>Erich Schwer</strong></a>, who was a contestant on her season of the ABC series. However, rumors swirled that the two were no longer together after the Bachelor Nation star was <a href=#>seen without her engagement ring</a>. In November 2022, the former couple revealed they <a href=#>called it quits</a> less than two months after their proposal aired during the Bachelorette season finale.</p><p>“It was hard,” Windey exclusively told Us Weekly after <a href=#>she addressed the split</a> for the first time on a November 2022, episode of DWTS. “Thank you for acknowledging that. And ultimately, I’m just grateful that I was able to do it on my own terms and when I was ready. It was just a new experience overall — being so public and being thrown into this. I think now it’s just kind of trying to move forward.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gabby-Windey-Sparks-Rumors-Shes-Dating-%E2%80%98Dancing-With-the-Stars-Pro-Alan-Bersten-After-Posting-About-Dinner-with-a-Mystery-Man-804.jpg><p>Following her split from Schwer, Windey and her fellow DWTS competitor <a href=#><strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong></a> made headlines for a potential romance after the twosome began to <a href=#>consistently flirt with one another</a> on social media.</p><p>“[Vinny’s] so much fun. We built a good friendship on the show and just I think like naturally kind of clicked,” the Illinois native told <a href=#>Us</a> in December 2022. “I think both of our senses of humor are similar, so [we are] just, like, flirting in the comments [and] seeing where things go.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> star, for his part, acknowledged he and Windey “have great chemistry” but exclusively told Us in January 2023 that <a href=#>they were not dating</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While on tour together this winter, Bersten seemingly donned one of Windey’s costumes and shared a photo of him in the outfit on his social media. The flirty interaction sparked fan speculation that the twosome may be more than good friends.</p><p>“My favorite looks from this tour,” he <a href=#>captioned the slideshow</a> with him in the blue dress as the last photo. In the comments section, Windey quipped: “You’re gonna stretch it out!!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagmZKXxm7DyKebnrFdmcS1v4yao5qmXZeys7%2FTnqVmq6CWv6x5w5qroqaXYr%2B2uc6rqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-crown-actress-elizabeth-debicki-is-spotted-with-a-new-boyfriend-kristian-rasmussen-in-london-478841-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Crown Actress Elizabeth Debicki Is Spotted With A New Boyfriend Kristian Rasmussen In Lond</span></a>
