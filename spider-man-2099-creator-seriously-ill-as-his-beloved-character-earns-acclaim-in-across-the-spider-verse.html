He has penned numerous iconic titles, including&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk,&nbsp;Aquaman,&nbsp;Young Justice, and&nbsp;Spider-Man, for which he wrote for Spider-Man 2099. His work has captured the imaginations of generations of fans.</p><p data-characters=681 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>Despite his career success and significant contributions to the industry, David now faces immense financial strain as he fights to recover. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A GoFundMe page</a> is live to help ease the financial burden on David. It’s sadly ironic that the creator of Spider-Man 2099 — featured in the film Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse that just raked in over&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$120.5 million during its opening weekend</a> — finds himself in a situation where he must turn to GoFundMe for support. David has been battling health issues since he developed debilitating musculoskeletal challenges in 2010. He suffered a stroke in 2012 and was subsequently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in 2015.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>On the bright side, MCU fans are making contributions of all sizes to support the creative genius and his family. Many have left words of encouragement and gratitude on David’s GoFundMe page in recognition of his colossal creative vision. One fan wrote:</p><p>Reading Spider-Man 2099 was life changing. I just watched Across The Spider-Verse today where I was thrilled to see Mig come to life, and felt inspired anew, so when I found out the creator is struggling I had to pitch in what I could. I’m grateful for your work, and the creativity you’ve put into the world.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>Let’s hope the GoFundMe campaign raises enough money so Peter David can recover free from financial pressure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmhlJq%2FbrnAp2RraGlueqS%2BxJqrqKpdqLKztc6uqqWxXZ65rXnArGShoaNir6a4zq%2BcnWWTna6zrcKtnKtllZa%2Fr7%2BMmpqcpJGeum61zWaYnKqfqMBuwMeeZKyomZmys3nVnqmsnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./damson-idris.html><span>←</span><span>Damson Idris Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
