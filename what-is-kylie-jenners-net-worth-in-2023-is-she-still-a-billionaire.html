But is Jenner herself a billionaire?</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-kylie-jenner-s-net-worth-in-2023 data-injectable=false>Kylie Jenner’s net worth in 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kylie-jenner.png><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>The answer seems to be… probably not. The question of Jenner’s net worth has been an open one since 2018, when Forbes magazine placed her on their front cover. The following year, the magazine proclaimed her the world’s youngest self-made billionaire. Much debate followed, including the pertinent question of whether anyone born to parents with nine-figure fortunes can ever really be thought of as “self-made.”</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>But it’s also true that Jenner’s net worth was largely predicated not on her endorsements or the revenue from her reality TV show, but largely on the valuation of her company Kylie Cosmetics. In 2020, Forbes published <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an in-depth article</a> which described Jenner as having artificially inflated estimates of her personal worth for years, stating that the organization no longer thought Jenner was a billionaire. Jenner’s representatives issued a response, denying that Jenner had lied or falsified tax returns.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>As per Forbes, in June 2023 Jenner’s net worth was estimated at $580 million – enough to make her one of the ten richest women in the United States alongside the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madonna and Dolly Parton</a>, but some way short of billionaire status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZuuuaqxjKOcp6aVp8BuusStZLCnoqm1brXNZmlpamNitrR50qGcZquknrmtecBmmaKknJ68r63Iq5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhonda-mccullough-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Rhonda Mccullough Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
