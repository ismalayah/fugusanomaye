Their caption reads: “Caleb McLaughlin as Miles Morales! After the multiverse was kinda mentioned in FFH trailer, here is a live action art of a Miles Morales casting I thought would be cool.”</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Check out their work in the gallery below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Caleb-McLaughlin-Miles-Morales-Spider-Man.jpg><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>McLaughlin isn’t a bad choice for a live-action Miles. At 17 years old, he’s also the perfect age to play the teenage hero who’s usually depicted as a couple of years younger than Peter was when he first got his powers. The actor’s star is also on the rise, since he’s world-famous from his role as Lucas Sinclair on the Netflix show, so Marvel would be smart to snap him up now. What’s more, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caleb himself has teased</a> that he’d be interested in the part in an old Instagram post.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Luckily,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a>&nbsp;did leave the door open for <strong>Miles Morales</strong> to appear in Spider-Man 3.&nbsp;Yes, there was talk of the multiverse, but this was just hot air made up by Mysterio. The five-year time jump is more promising, though, as Aaron Davis’ young nephew Miles (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mentioned in&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming</a>) might just be old enough now to become a superhero.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9KtqZqml5q%2Fbr%2FTmqlmpZOqwG65yKWcrGWdpL%2BiuMSsZJynn6F6p63NZpirrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-alison-brie-a-nudist-in-real-life.html><span>←</span><span>Is Alison Brie a nudist in real life?</span></a>
