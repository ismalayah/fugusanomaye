Of course, the fact that the Atomic Blonde actress has a transgender child has now become a part of the conversation after she helped the drag community raise over half a million dollars to combat anti-LGBT legislation and specifically, legislation that is attempting to ban drag queen children’s book readings for kids.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>When Megyn Kelly heard those words, she challenged Theron to come “f-k her up!” She sees the drag queen performances as an attempt to groom children, which is a common thought among conservatives who are growing in their belief that the LGBTQ+ community is targeting kids. Kelly’s response is quite surreal given the fact that Theron played her in Bombshell, a film about sexual harassment at FOX News when Roger Allies was running the place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Megyn Kelly to Charlize Theron: know what you're supporting. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gEDGjVBIB4</a></p>— ℝ𝕠𝕔𝕜𝕖𝕥 (@rdbrewer4) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>While Theron is yet to respond, her fans have accepted Kelly’s challenge on her behalf and are already placing their bets.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Charlize Theron is a classically trained ballerina who is combat trained due to all the action movies she’s been in.</p><p>Money’s on her. <a href=#>https://t.co/YBiMkEgs9s</a></p>— @<a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=c28bafa3acab80a3b0a0a3b0abac82a6abb1a3a0aea7a6ecb1ada1aba3ae>[email&nbsp;protected]</a> (@Imani_Barbarin) <a href=#>May 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Imagine if Theron actually takes this challenge seriously.
