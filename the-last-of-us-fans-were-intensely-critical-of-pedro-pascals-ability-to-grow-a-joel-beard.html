It’s no wonder, then, that many of them would want to gatekeep the franchise with their dying breath, latching onto even the minutest discrepancy to naysay the forthcoming live-action adaptation by HBO.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>In this case, the criticism of Pedro Pascal’s casting more often than not involves his patchy beard, which, according to fans, isn’t even close to Joel’s iconic whiskers. Never mind his acting chops or whether he’s the right choice to portray a character originally embodied by Troy Baker, we want to see some proper facial hair on that gun-toting, brick-throwing protagonist.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>You might find the subject too absurd to bring up or pay any attention to, but according to the show’s executive producer Craig Mazin (Chernobyl), this is actually a deal-breaker for a lot of TLOU enthusiasts.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>“You’re laughing, but for some people, that’s a serious deal-breaker for them!” He said in a recent interview chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “They’re like, ‘Oh my God, he can’t even have the same beard as Joel in the game.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-last-of-us-trailer1-e1672850615390.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The_Last_of_Us_Bill.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The_Last_of_Us_Ellie_Bella.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The_Last_of_Us_Ellie_Riley.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The_Last_of_Us_JoelEllie.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The_Last_Of_Us_cast.jpg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay wouldn’t have been our go-to choices to portray The Last of Us leads, either, but if the trailers are anything to go by, the pair have truly brought Joel and Ellie to life in a way that might actually end up transcending our ideas of the two characters. They might even offer the story more depth, as blasphemous as that will sound.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=false>At any rate, we officially have less than two weeks until the show makes its debut on HBO platforms. You can expect the first episode to drop on January 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmo5qrpGK8p3nUrGSfmZ6oerix0Z5koqakmru0scuyZJyqmam2pK3LZqafZaCasbO7jKmYrJuRocBurcGio6KsqWLBsHnGq6awZZFit7Cxy2aZnpmimXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./battling-ptsd-living-local-full-show.html><span>←</span><span>Battling PTSD | Living Local Full Show</span></a>
