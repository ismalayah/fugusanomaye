The film stars Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, Jackson A. Dunn, Matt Jones, and Meredith Hagner.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Despite Gunn’s involvement being celebrated in the marketing, he didn’t actually write or direct the film. Turns out, James’ brother, Brian Gunn, and his cousin, Mark Gunn, handled screenwriting duties. Meanwhile, David Yarovesky (2014’s The Hive) directed the project.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>The film had a decent reception by critics and fans, who might not have thought the story lived up to its potential but still praised certain horror sequences and the general novelty of twisting a conventional superhero narrative into an R-rated bloodbath. (Although we already had Logan and two Deadpools by that point, so the approach didn’t feel as fresh as it would have in, say, 2010).</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>Still, it made $33 million against a $6 million budget, so co-producer The H Collective is currently working on a sequel, per a recent report by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>. The news has Brightburn fans excited for another game of hide-and-seek with a killer who can hide in the sky. And for those who haven’t seen the original, maybe it’s time to test just how hopeless a superhero movie can make you feel.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-you-stream-brightburn data-injectable=false>Where can you stream Brightburn?</h2><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>Brightburn is currently streaming on Hulu, at least in the United States.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Mileage will vary on the thematic value of a story like this, but the simplicity of the premise and surprisingly reasonable runtime go a long way to engender goodwill toward a little jerk who puts on a cape for no other reason than to burn the world.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>Sure, there’s some overlap with Max Landis and Josh Trank’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronicle</a>&nbsp;— the real trailblazer in the superheroes-as-bad-guys subgenre that released in 2012 — but Landis’ screenplay has mega-edgelord vibes, and director Trank is too slavish to his video-capture gimmick.&nbsp;Brightburn&nbsp;serves its doom-and-gloom without such thematic or visual pretense, and there’s something refreshing in that.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>We’re not sure there’s enough story here for a sequel, but when has that ever stopped Hollywood?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6tbuMrKurnZGieqO%2ByKCfrZqlp7tw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./priscilla-murray-gibson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-228611-html.html><span>←</span><span>Priscilla Murray Gibson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biogr</span></a>
