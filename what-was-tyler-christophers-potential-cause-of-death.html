While some people have used his death to push COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">similar to when Matthew Perry passed away</a>, there is no evidence to support a vaccine being the cause of death.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>The likelier possibility is that Christopher’s previous issues with alcohol led to the heart issues, resulting in his death. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johns Hopkins Medicine</a> states that alcohol abuse can lead to high blood pressure, stroke, and even heart failure. As Benard pointed out, Christopher was very open about his issues with alcohol abuse, even writing a full story about it for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Readers Digest</a>.</p><p>“My addiction to alcohol contributed to losing my jobs on General Hospital and Days of Our Lives—no one else is to blame. I suffered from delirium tremens, the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal, and almost died after falling and hitting my head on a bathtub. I spent my recovery living with a family member in Ohio.”</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Christopher also discussed how the isolation he faced during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic led him to “fall back into some similar habits,” which “allowed the mania associated with [his] bipolar disorder to come into full effect.”</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>While we cannot know for certain what exactly caused the cardiac issue he faced, we can all hope that his remaining family members find peace after his tragic passing.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, please call SAMHSA’s National Helpline, <a href=#>1-800-662-HELP (4357)</a> (also known as the Treatment Referral Routing Service) or TTY: <a href=#>1-800-487-4889</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZq6aq12pxq2x0WaaoaqZqMGwvMeeqaxloKTBprrTopilZZOWwrSxjKidZpyVlsGpew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-there-an-amazing-digital-circus-episode-2-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>Is there an Amazing Digital Circus episode 2 release date?</span></a>
