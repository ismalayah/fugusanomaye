The actress, as a cancer patient, has accepted that she’s never going to have a wrinkle-less face and a perfect body because of what her body has been through. Shannen Doherty has obviously never gotten invasive plastic surgery but she did get a cosmetic procedure to get her eyebrows filled.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Shannen Doherty</span> has been around for long and in lots of movies and television. She is still remembered as <span>Jenny</span><span>Wilder</span> from <span>Little House on the Prairie</span>, and she is also known for playing the role of <span>Maggie Malene</span> in<span> Girls Just</span><span>Want to Have Fun</span>. She is recognized for portraying the role of <span>Kris Witherspoon</span> in <span>Our House</span>, and she has also done the role of <span>Heather Duke</span> in <span>Heathers</span>. She is widely loved for her performance as <span>Brenda Walsh</span> in <span>Beverly</span><span>Hills, 90210</span>, and she is also appreciated for her role as <span>Prue Halliwell</span> in <span>Charmed</span>, and<span> Dobbs</span> in <span>Fortress</span>.</p><p>Shannen Doherty is a veteran <span><span>actress</span></span> who has been in the entertainment industry for more than 50 years. For someone who has been in showbiz for half a century, she has never subscribed to the beauty standard of looking youthful forever and has never succumbed to plastic surgery. Her perspective on it comes from the fact that she’s a cancer patient and her acceptance of her body which has been through a lot! Here’s everything to know about it!</p><p>You might also like to read the <span><span>plastic surgery</span></span> stories of <span><span>Debbie Gibson</span></span> and <span><span>Michelle Visage</span></span>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannen-doherty-does-not-relate-to-plastic-surgery-face></span>Shannen Doherty Does Not Relate to Plastic Surgery Face!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Shannen Doherty</span> (<span>@thesando</span>) has a strong distaste for Hollywood’s obsession with the use of plastic surgery to look youthful. She hates the trend of <span>Botox</span> and <span>fillers</span>. She has only ever gotten one non-invasive cosmetic procedure to get her eyebrows filled.</p><p>Doherty has resisted the urge to go under the knife and injections just because everyone else is doing so. For someone who has been in Hollywood for more than 50 years now, it’s very commendable and courageous of her because you know how toxic the industry is and how harsh the beauty standards are. She has not just not given into plastic surgery but she has also been very vocal about her stance <span>against Hollywood’s obsession with Botox and fillers</span>.</p><p>Shannen Doherty can’t relate to the women who are all Botox-ed and filled-up, and she wants to see more women like her on the screen, the ones who have embraced their bodies and faces and aged naturally, the ones whose face shows that they have lived. In June 2021, she shared a bare-faced selfie on Instagram and expressed her dislike of plastic surgery and changing yourself to fit in.</p><p><span><span>Watching movies tonight and noticed there were few female characters I could relate to. You know, women without fillers, without Botox, without a facelift. Women who embraced their face and all the experience it showed. I have lived. I love that I’ve lived and that my face reflects my life. I survived a lot yes cancer but more than that. I embrace me now. Finally. Done with the perception magazines and Hollywood try to make us in to. I want to see women like me. Women like us.</span></span></p><p>Shannen Doherty’s perspective on plastic surgery comes from the fact that she has breast cancer and her body has gone through a lot. In an interview, she said that her battle with cancer was what forced her to reevaluate her <span>relationship with her body</span>. She has accepted that she is not going to have the perfect figure and the perfect face and that she’s not going to be hard on herself for that. She’s not going to get plastic surgery for that.</p><p><span><span>What [people] don’t realize is that your body has been through something so incredibly difficult that your body never fully bounces back. I’m trying to figure out how to accept who I am now. I’m never going to be the size I used to be. Some of my meds that I’m on keep zapping the collagen out of me, so I’m never going to have a wrinkle-free face. I’m critical of myself. But there are some things you can’t fight. I’m trying to be kinder to myself. And I try to live each day as an amazing, precious gift that I’ve been given.</span></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannen-doherty-has-not-had-invasive-plastic-surgery-she-once-had-her-eyebrows-done-and-thats-it></span>Shannen Doherty Has Not Had Invasive Plastic Surgery; She Once Had Her Eyebrows Done and That’s It!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The <span>Beverly Hills, 90210</span> star has strong opinions about plastic surgery which exposes the superficiality of Hollywood and stresses the importance of loving our faces and bodies. So, she obviously has not gone under the knife but she has gotten a non-invasive cosmetic procedure. Just earlier this year, she got her <span>eyebrows filled</span>. She made a post sharing that she had the procedure and that she was thrilled with the results.</p><p>Though it might seem nothing to get eyebrows done, for <span>Shannen Doherty</span> who has been battling with cancer and struggling with her eyebrows because of chemotherapy, it was a huge deal. She looked very happy and radiant in the after snaps posted by the professional who did her brows and I don’t think it’s just because of the brows. She said the procedure felt great. Her stance on plastic surgery remains the same because the procedure she had is non-invasive.</p><p><span><span>Since chemo, I have struggled with my eyebrows. As you can see, they were sparse and i am not the person that enjoys waking up and filling them in every morning. </span><span>I am beyond thrilled with @eyebrowking_ and the boost of confidence this gave me is priceless. You are the king Tiago. Much appreciation and love sent your way.</span></span></p><p>That’s all the ‘plastic surgery’ Shannen Doherty has had. She got her eyebrows filled in by Tiago Sampaio who does micro pigmentation on eyebrows. He said that it was a pleasure working for her.</p><p><span><span>Today I had the pleasure to meet @theshando and I was able to enhance her eyebrows shape ! Thank you for trusting us ❤️</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYlruvsc1mm6iglafBur%2BMrKurp56ceqW10q2YrKyVYrynec%2BlmKysmZh6tMHRoJyrsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-quintanilla-2.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Quintanilla Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
